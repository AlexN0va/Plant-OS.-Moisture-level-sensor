# LED-indicating-Moisture

Have you ever wanted to take extra care fo your plants in a easy manner? This is a little project I've been working on. Its purpose is to indicate the moiusture level of plant soil and display that through a website and LEDs. This project uses a ESP-32 to host a HTML page and uses WS2812B LED strips to indicate the moisture level through an LED.
