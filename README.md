# LED-indicating-Moisture

#### Materials
This simple project gives you opportunity to do that with two main components 
  1. ESP-32
  2. WS2812B LED strips
  3. Soil Moisture Sensor
  4. Plant
 

#### About
Have you ever wanted to take extra care of your plants in an easy manner? This is a little project I've been working on. Its purpose is to indicate the moisture level of plant soil and display that through a website and LEDs. This project uses an ESP-32 to host an HTML page and uses WS2812B LED strips to indicate the moisture level through an LED. 

This project is one step forward to connecting the world of computer science and engineering with nature. The purpose of this project was to test the different ways in which humans can learn to incorporate more nature in their technology-driven lives. Through an HTML page and LEDs, this is an example of a fun way humans can care for and interact with plants around their house. 

I hope to implement new features to this project like controlling and changing the LED color through the HTML page. I also want this project to serve as a resource to learn more about the specific plant being sensed by giving more information about the plant and how to care for it.
